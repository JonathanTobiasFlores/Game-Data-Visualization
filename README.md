# Project Title
Video Game Sales Data Visualization (Super catchy title)

## Project Description
The Video Game Sales Data Visualization project aims to provide interactive visualizations of video game sales data. The project utilizes a dataset containing information about video game sales, including attributes such as name, genre, platform, year, and publisher.

The main features of the application include:
- Searching for games by name, genre, platform, year, and publisher
- Pagination to navigate through the search results
- Displaying interactive bar charts to visualize global sales data of video games

The project's objective is to allow users to explore and analyze video game sales trends based on various criteria. Insights provided through the interactive visualization include understanding the distribution of video game sales across different genres, platforms, years, and publishers.

## Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface and interactive components.
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js library for creating interactive bar charts to visualize video game sales data.
- **Backend**: FastAPI framework for building the API endpoint to fetch and filter the video game sales data.
- **Data Processing**: Pandas library for data manipulation and filtering based on user queries.

The chosen technologies offer several benefits, including ease of development, scalability, and flexibility in creating interactive visualizations and handling backend data processing.

## How to Use
1. Visit the deployed application link.
2. Use the search inputs to filter video games by name, genre, platform, year, and publisher.
3. Adjust the page size input to change the number of search results per page.
4. Interact with the pagination buttons to navigate through the search results.
5. Explore the interactive bar chart to visualize global sales data of the displayed video games.

## Additional features
- Implemented dynamic pagination based on the total number of search results.
- Added validation on the server side to handle search queries and prevent network errors.
- Enhanced user input handling on the frontend to filter out non-alphanumeric characters.
